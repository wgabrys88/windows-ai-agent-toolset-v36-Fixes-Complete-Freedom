DO NOT EXECUTE AS IS - there is no brakes, when it decides to draw a cat features using mouse drag actions your mouse is out of your control completelly - this is great because it proves that actions chains and in any number - SUPER

But not super when you loosing control over PC, so watch out.

Anyway - its a fix this, fix that result of today work, its a BASE for future development, no constraints = simple code = easier to manually review how to make this architecture fully working. THIS IS
THE MOMENT TO SEARCH FOR ANY MAGIC NUMBERS HIDDEN IN CODE - AND TO UNDERSTAND THE ARCHITECTURE MANUALLY, no AI - the code is just 300+ lines (I remember at the start I was dancing between 800 and 1500)

So, this is a proof of progress, less lines and works. And the modularity, the painting on screen(shots) and giving that to model instead of text is a promising feature (this will be pure ai development to draw low level arrows and stuff - actually its drawing them alreasy but there is a lot to improve in terms of visibility and ai/human read-friendly style)

Anyway PROFIT
